                <p class="about-us">Formerly a salesman working for the insurance industry, I was encouraged to learn programming by my brother-in-law. At first I found coding to be scary and a bit daunting, then I realized that coding can be quiet enjoyable. Convinced by my brother-in-law's work life balance and his fulfillment from his career, I made the leap of faith and quit my career. I eventually developed a passion for coding and find messing around with different logic strings to be amusing. My goal is to continue to grow my passion for coding and eventually develop my own application so I can showcase my creativity.</p>
